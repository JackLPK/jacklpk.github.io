## A very clunky blog...

Welcome to my blog!

Current situation:

![A Test Image](/images/blogs/blank.png)

Welp, this is the first time a made a blog...

Okay, jokes aside. I will be posting personal thoughts and experiences about tech and code.

During the makings of this blog, I found these resources very helpful:

- [Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs) by [_Fireship_](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)
- [Static Blog With Next.js and Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjeefD8sac) by [_Traversy Media_](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia)

NextJS with Markdown is an fun way to go but it definitely took me some time.

Obviously, there are a lot of ways to build a blog. If time is of essense, something like blogger or obsidian publish would be better.

And most paid services would also provide better search engine optimisations.
