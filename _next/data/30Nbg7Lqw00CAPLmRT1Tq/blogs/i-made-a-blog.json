I will be posting personal thoughts and experiences about tech and code.\r\n\r\nDuring the makings of this blog, I found these resources very helpful:\r\n\r\n- [Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs) by [_Fireship_](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)\r\n- [Static Blog With Next.js and Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjeefD8sac) by [_Traversy Media_](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia)\r\n\r\nNextJS with Markdown is an fun way to go but it definitely took me some time.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are a lot of ways to build a blog. If time is of essense, something like blogger or obsidian publish would be better.\r\n\r\nAnd most paid services would also provide better search engine optimisations.\r\n\r\n> I have no idea how you found this blog.\r\n>\r\n","slug":"i-made-a-blog"},"__N_SSG":true}
