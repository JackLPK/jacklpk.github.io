There are quite a number of choices for virtual environments, e.g. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (Python standard library), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Pyenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), .etc.\n[miniconda/Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) could also be in consideration if you want fine control of the Python version.\nI use Poetry most of the time. For this article, I'll use the default options for poetry.\n\nDon't let the message below scare you, it just need a simple fix.\n\n```sh\n> mkdir pyside6-sandbox && cd pyside6-sandbox\n>\n> poetry init -n\n> ls\npyproject.toml\n> poetry add pyside6\n\nThe current project\\'s Python requirement (>=3.10,<4.0) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:\n  - pyside6 requires Python <3.12,>=3.7, so it will not be satisfied for Python >=3.12,<4.0\n\nBecause no versions of pyside6 match >6.4.1,<7.0.0\n and pyside6 (6.4.1) requires Python <3.12,>=3.7, pyside6 is forbidden.\nSo, because pyside6-sandbox depends on PySide6 (^6.4.1), version solving failed.\n\n  • Check your dependencies Python requirement: The Python requirement can be specified via the `python` or `markers` properties\n\n    For pyside6, a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to \">=3.10,<3.12\"\n\n    https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#python-restricted-dependencies,\n    https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#using-environment-markers\n```\n\nTo install PySide6, we specify the python version.\n\n```sh\n> poetry add --python '>=3.10,<3.12' pyside6\nUsing version ^6.4.1 for PySide6\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.4s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage operations: 4 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals\n\n  • Installing shiboken6 (6.4.1)\n  • Installing pyside6-essentials (6.4.1)\n  • Installing pyside6-addons (6.4.1)\n  • Installing pyside6 (6.4.1)\n\n> poetry shell\nSpawning shell within some-where/virtualenvs/pyside6-sandbox-UCbHYWjN-py3.10\n> (pyside6-sandbox-py3.10)\n```\n\nDONE!\n\n## But wait! There's more!\n\nThe `pyside6` package included a bunch of tools.\nJust make sure we are in our virtual environment.\n\n- pyside6-assistant\n- pyside6-deploy\n- pyside6-designer\n- pyside6-genpyi\n- pyside6-linguist\n- pyside6-lrelease\n- pyside6-lupdate\n- pyside6-metaobjectdump\n- pyside6-project\n- pyside6-qml\n- pyside6-qmlformat\n- pyside6-qmlimportscanner\n- pyside6-qmllint\n- pyside6-qmlls\n- pyside6-qmltyperegistrar\n- pyside6-qtpy2cpp\n- pyside6-rcc\n- pyside6-uic\n\nIf you are on Powershell, use this command to see what you get:\n\n```powershell\n> (pyside6-sandbox-py3.10)gcm -Name 'pyside6-*'\n```\n\nTo use QtDesigner:\n\n```sh\n> (pyside6-sandbox-py3.10) pyside6-qtdesigner &  # launch in background with '&'\n```\n\nIf you are new to the Qt ecosystem, make sure to checkout:\n\n- pyside6-designer\n- pyside6-rcc\n- pyside6-uic\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI know webapps are gaining a lot of traction for a long while, but writing desktop application is always a fun thing to do for me.\n\nWhat actually reinspark me to give Qt a look again is this tutorial by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp).\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"1280\"\n  height=\"720\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1N9JzNax2k\"\n  title=\"Learn Python GUI Development for Desktop – PySide6 and Qt Tutorial\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1N9JzNax2k)\n\nAlthough Qt's documentation is a little bit lacking in the Python side, Qt is a powerful and mature ecosystem for building desktop applications. Definitely worth give it a try!\n","year":"2022","month":"12","day":"30","slug":"easy-pyside6-setup"},"__N_SSG":true}
